#Our Classifier
Our classifier is a custom built tensorflow model built using keras. At the moment we haven't been able to start training because creating a method for creating a dataset is taking up most of our time. The dataset is being made from the images provided from RJI. Due to the limited dataset we have, our accuracy will be substansialy lower untill a large enough dataset is created. There are lots of bugs being created due to the choice to implement a bespoke model, but in the end this will most likely provide the most accurate model once proper training data is generated.
